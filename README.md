# ESP32 Flat Monitor

**Goal:**  
A lightweight system for remotely checking on the flat — including temperature, humidity, and camera snapshots — using an ESP32, MQTT, and a simple web client.

---

## 🌐 Overview

This project uses an ESP32 device equipped with:
- A camera ([OV5640](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/LightImaging/OV5640_datasheet.pdf))
- A temperature and humidity sensor ([DHT11](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/758/DHT11-Technical-Data-Sheet-Translated-Version-1143054.pdf))
- A passive buzzer

The ESP32 connects to the home Wi-Fi and communicates via my own MQTT broker, providing access to real-time sensor data and user-triggered updates.

## 🧩 MQTT Interface

### 📰 Discovery

- `esp32/available_sensors`  
  The ESP32 publishes a JSON list of currently available sensors.  
  Example payload:
  ```json
  [
    { "name": "temp", "type": "text/plain" },
    { "name": "humidity", "type": "text/plain" },
    { "name": "air_quality", "type": "text/plain" },
    { "name": "camera", "type": "image/jpeg" }
  ]
  ```

Clients subscribe to this topic on connect and use the metadata to dynamically render controls and correctly display responses.

---


### Requesting Sensor Data

- `esp32/request/<sensorName>`  
  The web client sends requests here.  
  The `<sensorName>` must match one of the available sensors.

  #### Example:
  ```
  esp32/request/camera      → triggers a new photo capture  
  esp32/request/humidity    → triggers humidity reading  
  esp32/request/air_quality → triggers air quality percentage
  esp32/request/temp        → triggers temperature reading
  ```

The ESP32 will buzz once to confirm reception of any valid or invalid request.

### Receiving Sensor Data

- `esp32/response/<sensorName>`  
  ESP32 publishes sensor results to this topic.

  - Topic pattern: esp32/response/<sensorName>
  - Payload: Value returned by the sensor

  #### Example payloads:
  ```
  esp32/response/temp: "23.5"
  esp32/response/humidity: "69.6"
  esp32/response/air_quality: "47"
  esp32/response/camera: (Base64-encoded JPEG string)
  ```

---

### Error Handling

- `esp32/response/error`  
  Any malformed requests, unavailable sensors, or failures are published here.

  #### Example payload:
  ```
  sensor_unknown:airflow
  invalid_topic:bad/request/humidity
  ```

## 💻 Web Client

The frontend is a static HTML + JavaScript page that:
- Connects to the MQTT broker via WebSocket
- Subscribes to `esp32/available_sensors` and `esp32/response/#` topics
- Renders one button per available sensor using metadata from `available_sensors`
- Sends requests via MQTT on button click
- Displays each result dynamically based on the sensor type (text/plain or image/jpeg)

The client is fully decoupled from the ESP32 implementation. It relies exclusively on metadata provided via MQTT.

## 🧪 Development & Testing

All ESP32 code is developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) with separation of logic and hardware:

- Business logic is tested with PlatformIO’s `native` environment
-	ESP32-specific components are tested in esp32 integration tests
- All sensors are represented by test doubles (fakes/stubs) for isolated testing
- Sensor registry, MQTT dispatch, message structure, and system boot logic are tested without hardware
